# Codeial
Codeial is Social Media website which allows you to create your account and Post your content publicly , chatting with friends and etc. Lots more features are on its way to be implemented. This is going to be my first full stack website and I hope all my efforts are going to be worth it.

Technologies Used till now:
 -> HTML,CSS and Javascript
 -> SCSS 
 -> EJS
 -> Node Js in backend to run javascript and to communicate with server
 -> Express as a library to make working with things easier
 -> MongoDB as a database which is nosql JSON based key value pair database
 -> And some of useful libraries such as 'passportJS' for authentication, 'multer' to store link of uploaded files in database, 'connect-flash' for displaying flash messages which further made easy to create and animated using 'Noty'plugin
 -> And more .......
 
 We have not used any framework till now.
